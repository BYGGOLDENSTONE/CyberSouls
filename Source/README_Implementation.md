## Setup Instructions

1. Open the project in Unreal Engine 5.4
2. Compile the C++ code
3. Create new blueprints inheriting from:
   - `CybersoulsEnemyBase` for each enemy type
   - Set up the AI Controller in enemy blueprints
4. Create Input Actions for:
   - Target Lock (Tab)
   - Target Change Left/Right (Q/E)
   - Slash (Left Click)
   - QuickHack 1/2/3 (1/2/3 keys)
5. Add these Input Actions to the character's Input Mapping Context
6. Create data tables for abilities and QuickHacks
7. Spawn enemies in the level with proper AI controllers

## Next Steps

1. Create visual effects for abilities
2. Add animations for attacks and dodges
3. Implement enemy spawn system
4. Create ability data tables
5. Add sound effects
6. Polish HUD with proper UI widgets
7. Balance gameplay values
8. Add more enemy variants

## Code Organization

- `Attributes/` - Attribute management
- `Abilities/` - Ability system and QuickHacks
- `Combat/` - Body part targeting and target lock
- `Enemy/` - Enemy classes and AI
- `UI/` - HUD and user interface

The modular architecture makes it easy to add new abilities, enemy types, and features as needed.
