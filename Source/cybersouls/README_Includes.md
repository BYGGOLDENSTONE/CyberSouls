# Include Path Updates Summary

## Changes Made to Fix Include Paths

### 1. Build Configuration Updates (cybersouls.Build.cs)
- Added module dependencies: `AIModule` and `NavigationSystem`
- Updated public include paths to point to the new `Public/` subdirectories

### 2. Header File Updates
- `TargetLockComponent.h`: Updated to use full path for `BodyPartComponent.h`
  - Changed from: `#include "BodyPartComponent.h"`
  - Changed to: `#include "cybersouls/Public/Combat/BodyPartComponent.h"`

### 3. Character File Relocations
- Moved `cybersoulsCharacter.h` to `Public/Character/`
- Moved `cybersoulsCharacter.cpp` to `Private/Character/`
- Updated all references to use new path: `cybersouls/Public/Character/cybersoulsCharacter.h`

### 4. Include Path Convention
All include paths now follow the pattern:
- For headers in Public: `#include "cybersouls/Public/[Category]/[File].h"`
- From cpp to corresponding header: Same pattern

### 5. Files That Were Updated
Files that had their include paths updated for the character relocation:
- `Private/Character/cybersoulsCharacter.cpp`
- `Private/Game/cybersoulsGameMode.cpp`
- `Private/Enemy/CybersoulsEnemyAIController.cpp`
- `Private/UI/CybersoulsHUD.cpp`
- `Private/AI/CybersoulsAIController.cpp`

### 6. New AI System Dependencies
- Created basic AI controller with proper includes
- Enemy AI controller now inherits from basic AI controller
- All AI includes use full paths

## Verification
All source files now use consistent include paths that match the new directory structure. The project should compile successfully with these updates.
